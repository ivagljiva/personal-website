About Me

I am a B.S. Biology/M.S. Computer Science co-terminal degree student at
Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL, currently in my fourth and
final year. I am interested in research questions in computational biology and
bioinformatics, specifically in the field of genomics. Though my research and
interests are interdisciplinary and I spend most of my time on a computer, at
heart I consider myself a biologist - I enjoy programming and often write computer
programs that will facilitate my research, but ultimately it is the
biologically-relevant results of my projects that pique my curiosity and motivate
my studies.

My career goal is to become a principal investigator and professor at a
research university so that I can continue to do two activities that I love -
study genomics and teach. Joining the co-terminal program to gain an
interdisciplinary foundation of knowledge in both biology and CS was my first
step in preparing for this future. As well as following standard undergraduate
curriculums for these fields, I have also had the opportunity to take advanced
courses that will be useful and relevant to my future research. These include
Functional Genomics, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Algorithms.

I am involved in a number of extracurricular endeavors that expand my
experience in these areas. First and foremost is my work as a research assistant
in Dr. Jean-Francois Pombert's lab. There, I have had the opportunity to learn
the ropes of genomics research - from culturing and DNA isolation to sequencing,
genome annotation and assembly. My projects focus primarily on comparative
genomics of bacterial genomes, though I have also assisted with more computational
work such as the development of a SNP-calling pipeline.
