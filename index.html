  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I am a B.S. Biology/M.S. Computer Science co-terminal degree student at Illinois
    Institute of Technology in Chicago, currently in my fourth and final year. I
    am interested in research questions in computational biology and bioinformatics,
    specifically in the field of genomics. Though my research and interests are
    interdisciplinary and I spend most of my time on a computer, at heart I consider
    myself a biologist - I enjoy programming and often write computer programs that
    will facilitate my research, but ultimately it is the biologically-relevant
    results of my projects that pique my curiosity and motivate my studies.
  </p>
  <p>
    My career goal is to become a principal investigator and professor at a research
    university so that I can continue to do two activities that I love - study
    genomics and teach. Joining the co-terminal program to gain an interdisciplinary
    foundation of knowledge in both biology and CS was my first step in preparing
    for this future. As well as following standard undergraduate curriculums for
    these fields, I have also had the opportunity to take advanced courses that will
    be useful and relevant to my future research. These include Functional Genomics,
    Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Algorithms, Data-intensive
    Computing, and Web Design.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am involved in a number of extracurricular endeavors that expand my experience
    in these areas. First and foremost is my work as a research assistant in Dr.
    Jean-Francois Pombert's lab. There, I have had the opportunity to learn the
    ropes of genomics research - from culturing and DNA isolation to sequencing,
    genome annotation and assembly. My projects focus primarily on comparative
    genomics of bacterial genomes, though I have also assisted with more
    computational work such as the development of a SNP-calling pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to research, I hone my teaching skills by working as a teaching
    assistant for the Computer Science department. Depending on my schedule, I run
    the lab section for one of two introductory programming courses - Introduction
    to Object-Oriented Programming I (a Java course) or Introduction to Computer
    Programming (a C++ course). This involves giving weekly review lectures and
    discussing homework assignments. Finally, I have recently joined a group of
    students who will be competing in the Student Cluster Competition run by the
    high- performance computing community. We are working towards optimizing
    scientific applications so that run efficiently on our custom-built cluster;
    this endeavor will give me more experience with computer hardware and an
    under-the-hood view of scientific computing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently applying to graduate school PhD programs in Computational Biology
    and related fields.
